	abstract = {Projected increases in the elderly population are expected to significantly increase the stress on family and professional caretakers. Stress, in the context of caregiving relationships, is a risk factor associated with increased prevalence of elder abuse in familial and institutional settings. As increasing numbers of older adults are moved from family caregiving to nursing home care settings, it becomes important to identify the pattern of elder abuse risk factors in nursing home facilities. An ecological model is proposed for better understanding the risk factors associated with elder abuse in nursing homes and the complex interaction of individual/person characteristics and contextual factors in institutional elder abuse. An ecological perspective to institutional elder abuse provides a framework for guiding and informing future research on the risk factors of nursing home abuse and, in turn, for the development of effective interventions and relevant social policies.},

He then performed meta-regression adjusting for location, risk and MC prevalence. When one or two of these adjustments in combination were applied MC appeared protective, but when all three were introduced the association remained signiﬁcant in high-risk populations, but not in general populations within Africa with a hypothetical MC prevalence of {\textless}25\% or elsewhere with hypothetical MC prevalence of {\textless}75\%. However, many MC prevalence values given differed from those reported in references cited (including all US studies). This and other problems invalidate his adjustments for MC prevalence, undermining most of his meta-regression results. Meta-regression is a highly sophisticated statistical tool and is prone to error if not applied correctly. The study contained a high risk of bias arising from confounding. We also question his use of crude, rather than adjusted, odds ratios and his inclusion of unpublished data, so precluding replication by others. Flawed statistics, opaque presentation of results and inclusion of previously repudiated arguments downplaying a role for MC in HIV prevention programmes should lead readers to be sceptical of the ﬁndings and conclusions of Van Howe’s study.},

The sample consisted of 350 transgender men and women who participated in the Virginia Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS). Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the competing outcomes associated with suicidal risk. Thirtyseven percent of trans men and women experienced at least one physical attack since the age of 13. On average, individuals experienced 3.97 (SD = 2.86) physical attacks; among these about half were attributed to one's gender identity or expression (mean = 2.08, SD = 1.96). In the multivariate multinomial regression, compared to those with no risk, being physically attacked increased the odds of both attempting and contemplating suicide regardless of gender attribution. Nevertheless, the relative impact of physical victimization on suicidal behavior was higher among those who were targeted on the basis of their gender identity or expression. Finally, no significant association was found between multiple measures of institutional discrimination and suicide risk once discriminatory and non-discriminatory physical victimization was taken into account. Trans men and women experience high levels of physical abuse and face multiple forms of discrimination. They are also at an increased risk for suicidal tendencies. Interventions that help transindividuals cope with discrimination and physical victimization simultaneously may be more effective in saving lives.},

The present study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of staff physical abuse among elderly individuals receiving nursing home care in Michigan. A random sample of 452 adults with elderly relatives, older than 65 years, and in nursing home care completed a telephone survey regarding elder abuse and neglect experienced by this elder family member in the care setting. Some 24.3\% of respondents reported at least one incident of physical abuse by nursing home staff. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the importance of various risk factors in nursing home abuse. Limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), older adult behavioral difﬁculties, and previous victimization by nonstaff perpetrators were associated with a greater likelihood of physical abuse. Interventions that address these risk factors may be effective in reducing older adult physical abuse in nursing homes. Attention to the contextual or ecological character of nursing home abuse is essential, particularly in light of the ﬁndings of this study.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Drug overdose is a significant public health problem, yet little is known about racial/ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and/or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration. This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship, response, revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Spatio-temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development, planning, and delivery of effective treatment need.
Methods: Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network (ODIN). The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age, gender and race/ethnicity, naloxone administrations and survivorship, drug(s) suspected of causing the overdose, victim outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and arrests) and average naloxone dosage per victim. Between group differences were tested using χ2 -tests of independence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics. All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment.
Results: About eighty-seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white, and seventy-one percent were between the ages of 20–39. White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females. A non-opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos. Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose. However, following naloxone administration, no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted. Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found. Finally, overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites.
Conclusions: This study found a significant, disparate impact of race/ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered. Further, individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug-related mortality, suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose. However, while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process, longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis.},

	abstract = {The theory of learning in games has extensively studied situations where agents respond dynamically to each other in light of a ﬁxed utility function. However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary as a result of past agent choices. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to formulate and analyze such models which feature game-environment feedback. For instance, a highly prevalent virus may incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for mask-wearing. What is the interplay between epidemic severity and the behaviors of a victim population? For initial answers, we develop a general framework using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which feature such game-environment feedback. We then apply this framework to a simple dynamic game-theoretic model of social precautions in an epidemic and give conditions under which maximallycautious social behavior in this model is stochastically stable.},

This research examined the longitudinal relationships between multiple measures of cognitive readiness to parent, parenting stress (initial level and growth) and child social-emotional competence at age 3. It was hypothesized that lack of cognitive readiness to parent would predict initial level and growth in PS and that initial level and change in parenting stress would, in turn, would be related to poor social-emotional development. Cognitive readiness to parent was assessed at baseline shortly after childbirth; parenting stress, conceptualized as diﬃcult child, parent-child dysfunction and parental distress, was assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postpartum (i.e. when children were 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years of age) using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1995); children’s socio-emotional functioning was assessed with behavioral rating scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) (BSID-II; Bayley, 1993) which was administered by professionals at age 3. Using a second order growth curve, or curve-of-factors model, the study’s hypotheses were tested with data from the Predicting and Preventing Neglect in Teen Mothers Study (2001–2007), a longitudinal study of 682 ﬁrst-time mothers. Results from the latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that parenting stress predicted child socio-emotional problems. Speciﬁcally, mothers who began parenthood with high stress levels had children with lower levels of pro-social functioning (i.e. more behavior problems). Two measures of cognitive readiness to parent were associated with lower levels of postpartum PS at baseline but social support moderated the relationship between readiness to parent and parenting stress. Implications for interventions aimed at identifying families with children at risk for emotional and developmental problems and/ or new parents who demonstrate changes in parenting stress during the postpartum period are discussed in context.},

This study sought to identify trajectories of postpartum PSE and depressive symptoms in new, first-time mothers using growth mixture modeling. Results demonstrated a class of women with “low risk” (88.8\%) who manifested low levels of depression and high levels of PSE during the postpartum period; a second group of women, labeled “early risk” (6.3\%) with high levels of depression that decreased over time but lower levels of PSE that remained fairly stable; and a final trajectory group deemed the “laterisk” class (4.9\%) with initially low levels of depression and high levels of PSE that significantly increased and decreased, respectively, over the period. Early childhood trauma, parenting stress, and poor parenting practices were associated membership in a high-risk class. Mothers in the high-risk groups reported children with more aggressive and defiant behavior at age 3. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for developing effective and sensitive interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Modeling the spatio-temporal characteristics of substantiated child maltreatment risk has signiﬁcant implications for child welfare policy.
Objective: This study quantiﬁes the spatiotemporal risk of child abuse and neglect in New Mexico at the census tract level over 9 years, identiﬁes areas of increased risk, and evaluates the role of multiple measures of social and housing insecurity on substantiated child maltreatment referrals. Participants and Setting: Child maltreatment substantiation data across 499 census tracts from 2007 to 2015 were obtained from the New Mexico Department of Public Health.
Methods: Substantiated referral counts were analyzed within census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical space-time models using Laplace approximation. Standardized incidence ratios, spatial risk, and probability exceedances were calculated and mapped.
Results: Multiple neighborhood structural factors were associated with an increased risk of substantiated child maltreatment, including the eviction rate (Incidence Density Ratio [IDR] = 1.09 [95 \% CrI = 1.01–1.12]), rent burden (IDR = 1.11 [95 \% CrI = 1.01–1.13]), urban tracts (IDR = 1.36 [95 \% CrI = 1.05–1.77]), food desert tracts (IDR = 1.21 [95 \% CrI = 1.04–1.41]), low income tracts (IDR = 1.27 [95 \% CrI = 1.09–1.49]), percent of households with no vehicle access ([IDR] = 1.27 [95 \% CrI = .247–6.47]), and percent of persons with a disability (IDR = 1.05 [95 \% CrI = 1.03–1.06]). The racial/ethnic diversity ratio, however, was associated with lower incidence of child maltreatment allegation risk (IDR = .988 [95 \% CrI = .982–.995]).
Conclusions: Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention eﬀorts should be aided by the characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns of household and housing vulnerability, particularly in low income, racially segregated neighborhoods.},

As well, an examination is conducted regarding the accessibility of Health Care Centers (HCCs) in relation to individuals in need of medical assistance. Distance-based measures of spatial association, including nearest neighbor and K-function analysis, were used to determine the clustering of calls at various spatial scales. Structural neighborhood characteristics (i.e., distance to the closest HCC) and physical and social vulnerability were used to predict the rate of calls for a heroinrelated injury per 1,000 persons in the city of Boston using a spatial autoregressive model. HCC catchment areas for the set of medical emergency calls were created using Voronoi tessellations. Results showed that the average nearest neighbor distance (NND) of each call for medical assistance was approximately 187 m or .12 miles. Calls for assistance became more probable and increasingly more spatially concentrated over the study period. The K-function analysis revealed that the calls clustered at different spatial scales and in proximity to HCCs. Average distance to the nearest HCC and Household/Disability vulnerability were significantly associated with the census tract call rate per 1,000 persons. The average travel distance between the calls for medical assistance and the nearest HCC was 941 m, or just over a half-mile. Policy implications for the provision, through HCCs, of a focused and comprehensive community-based support system in a large urban city for individuals with serious drug problems are discussed in context.},

The current study examined latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms using data from 3,819 respondents of the Adolescent Health Survey. Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.},

	abstract = {Physically abused youth are vulnerable to experiencing difficulties across multiple domains of school functioning. Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell’s model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the “school achievement” effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children’s lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.},

Few studies have focused on the nature of the context of adversity and their association with psychosocial outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the patterning of ACEs and to explore the resultant patterns’ association with HIV risk-taking, problem drinking, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogeneous, mutually exclusive “classes” of 11 of the most commonly used ACEs. The LCA resulted in four high-risk profiles and one low-risk profile, which were labeled: (1) highly abusive and dysfunctional (3.3\%; n ¼ 1,983), (2) emotionally abusive alcoholic with parental conflict (6\%, n ¼ 3,303), (3) sexual abuse only (4.3\%, n ¼ 2,260), (4) emotionally abusive and alcoholic (30.3\%, n ¼ 17,460), and (5) normative, low risk (56.3\%, n ¼ 32,950). Compared to the low-risk class, each high-risk profile was differentially associated with adult psychosocial outcomes even when the conditional CR within that class was similar. The results further our understanding about the pattern of ACEs and the unique pathways to poor health. Implications for child welfare systems when dealing with individuals who have experienced multiple forms of early childhood maltreatment and/or household dysfunction are discussed.},

This study investigated the change trajectories of both depressive and PTS symptomatology as well as their associations over time, focusing on the eﬀect of complex trauma. Data were obtained from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007), a nationally representative study of children and adolescents who were referred to child protective services for alleged maltreatment. The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) scale measured depressive symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current traumarelated symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model. The participants' initial levels of depressive and PTS symptomatology were signiﬁcantly and positively related; furthermore, any changes in these two outcomes were also correlated longitudinally. The initial assessment of PTS symptoms signiﬁcantly contributed to the advancement of more severe depressive symptoms over time. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between youth who remained in the home and those removed from the home. However, violence exposure, sexual abuse, gender and age were signiﬁcant predictors of level and rate of change in both PTS and depressive symptoms. PTS growth factors mediated the longitudinal relationship between witnessing severe violence and depressive symptoms. The ﬁndings suggest a complex developmental association between depressive and PTS symptomatology among CPS-involved youth that is rooted in early childhood experiences with complex trauma.},

	abstract = {Objectives. This study explores the predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors associated with parents' or guardians' decision to have their child initiate, continue, and complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.
Methods. Parents and guardians of children between the ages of 9 and 17 years who completed the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey collected by the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) were analyzed. Utilizing Andersen's health care beliefs model, we explored the sequential nature of the decision to vaccinate (i.e., the decision to receive the ﬁrst, second, and third dose), thereby allowing the independent variables to vary across each transition.
Results. Among all children, 3.7\% received exactly 1 shot, 16.3\% received at least one shot, and 8.9\% received all three shots. Among those who received at least one shot, 22.4\% received exactly one shot, 23.7\% received exactly 2 shots, and 54.9\% completed all 3 shots. A differential impact was observed across transitions. Predisposing factors, such as being Hispanic (OR = 1.9) and child age (OR = 1.4), signiﬁcantly predicted the decision to receive the ﬁrst dose but enabling factors, such as having a regular physician (OR = 4.5) and income (OR = .74) were more important for predicting completion.
Conclusions. The decision to initiate and complete HPV vaccination depends on a speciﬁc mix of enabling, predisposing, and need-based factors. Our analysis underscores the importance of modeling the vaccination decision in a manner that is consistent with how primary caregivers navigate real-life health care decisions for their children.},

Results showed significant patterns of spatial clustering (i.e., hot and cold spots) of CMAs across the county (Moran’s I ¼ .316, p {\textless} .001). A geographically weighted regression (GWR) was implemented to examine the relationship between CMAs and social vulnerability at the census-tract level, thereby overcoming the deficiencies of global models. Nonstationarity was detected across four indices of vulnerability (socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, household composition, and health vulnerability) as well as proximity to onpremise alcohol outlets, percentage of residents in each census tract affected by food deserts, and population density, in some cases showing countervailing effects depending on spatial location. A hierarchical clustering was performed on the GWR coefficients to identify spatial regimes, or clusters, across the county. The results yielded six spatial regimes of social vulnerability differentially related to CMA rates. The present study demonstrates the novelty of GWR in combination with a hierarchical cluster analysis for exploring how local contextual processes influence child maltreatment reporting rates across the county.},

	abstract = {This study quantifies the spatiotemporal risk of child abuse and neglect in Los Angeles at the census tract level over a recent 4-year period, identifies areas of increased risk, and evaluates the role of structural disadvantage in substantiated child maltreatment referrals. Child maltreatment data on 83,379 child maltreatment cases in 1,678 census tracts spanning 2006-2009 were obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Substantiated referral counts were analyzed across census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results showed that the unadjusted yearly rate of child abuse and neglect held fairly steady over the study period decreasing by only 2.57\%. However, the temporal term in the spatiotemporal model reflected a downward trend beginning in 2007. High rates of abuse and neglect were predicted by several neighborhood-level measures of structural burden. Every 1-unit decrease in the social vulnerability index reduced the risk of child abuse and neglect by 98.3\% (95\% CrI = 1.869-2.1042) while every 1-unit increase in the Black–White dissimilarity index decreased child abuse and neglect risk by 70.6\%. The interaction of these variables demonstrated the protective effect of racial heterogeneity in socially vulnerable neighborhoods. No such effect was found in neighborhoods characterized by low levels of vulnerability. Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention efforts should be aided by the characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns even after accounting for the role of race and place.},

	abstract = {Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how violence exposure (e.g. child maltreatment, witnessing community violence) inﬂuence both externalizing and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) symptoms among children in foster care. Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007) (NSCAW; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and PTS symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services (CPS) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n = 280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and PTS symptomatology were both signiﬁcantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the ﬁrst two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and PTS symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of PTS on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between PTS and externalizing symptoms and the eﬀect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.},

	abstract = {The geographical distribution of mortality has frequently been studied. Nevertheless, those studies often consider isolated causes of death. In this work, we aim to study the geographical distribution of mortality in urban areas, in particular, in 26 Spanish cities. We perform an overall study of 16 causes of death, considering that their geographical patterns could be dependent and estimating the dependence between the causes of death. We study the deaths in these 26 cities during the period 1996–2015 at the census tract level. A multivariate disease mapping model is used in order to solve the potential small area estimation problems that these data could show. We find that most of the geographical patterns found show positive correlations. This suggests the existence of a transversal geographical pattern, common to most causes of deaths, which determines those patterns to a higher/lower extent depending on each disease. The causes of death that exhibit that underlying pattern in a more prominent manner are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cirrhosis for men and cardiovascular diseases and dementias for women. Such findings are quite consistent for most of the cities in the study. The high positive correlation found between geographical patterns reflects the existence of both high and low-risk areas in urban settings, in general terms for nearly all the causes of death. Moreover, the high-risk areas found often coincide with neighborhoods known for their high deprivation. Our results suggest that dependence among causes of death is a key aspect to be taken into account when mapping mortality, at least in urban contexts.},

The magnitude of academic risk among these students is a serious concern given that school attachment, performance, and attainment closely relate to indicators of well-being across the lifespan. It is also important to consider that the experience of maltreatment is linked to both academic difficulty and formal system involvement. This paper highlights recent research focused on the academic performance of children and adolescents involved with child welfare and juvenile justice systems, with specific emphasis on highlighting prevention and intervention strategies that cut across systems. To meet the complex needs of these populations, school psychologists and other support staff should be cognizant of students’ academic needs and take a leadership role in collaborating within and across systems to meet them.},

The results indicate that delinquency cases originating in child welfare are less likely to receive probation, controlling for a wide range of factors including age, gender, race, and type of offense. The results also indicate that the child welfare system is a significant source of overrepresentation for African American youth in juvenile justice.

	abstract = {It has commonly been suggested that in modern cities individual or household deprivation (for example, low income or education) is amplified by area level deprivation (for example, lack of jobs or good schools), in ways which damage the health of the poorest and increase health inequalities. The aim of this study was to determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005–2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and percentage of data zones containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A \& E hospitals, parks, waste disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities.},

Data Source Central cancer registry data (2006–2008) from three Appalachian states were linked to Medicare claims and census data. Study Design Exploratory spatial analysis preceded the statistical model based on negative binomial regression to model predictors and effect modification by geographic subregions. Principal Findings Exploratory spatial analysis revealed geographically varying effects of area deprivation and screening on LSBC. In the negative binomial regression model, predictors of LSBC included receipt of screening, area deprivation, supply of mammography centers, and female population aged {\textgreater}75 years. The most deprived counties had a 3.31 times greater rate of LSBC compared to the least deprived. Effect of screening on LSBC was significantly stronger in northern Appalachia than elsewhere in the study region, found mostly for high-population counties. Conclusions Breast cancer screening and area deprivation are strongly associated with disparity in LBSC in Appalachia. The presence of geographically varying predictors of later stage tumors in Appalachia suggests the importance of place-based health care access and risk.},

	abstract = {This study takes advantage of a unique opportunity to observe structural and psychosocial processes of multisystem collaborations primarily from the perspectives of professionals attempting to bring about change in practice with crossover youth. The involvement of maltreated youth in the juvenile justice system is a persistent problem that can compound vulnerable youths' risks for problematic developmental outcomes. Youth outcomes may be improved when professionals in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems communicate and collaborate more effectively in case assessment, planning and management. The Crossover Youth Practice Model (CYPM) is an attempt to translate these and other research ﬁndings into practice largely through multisystem collaborations. This study presents an approximately two year-long, ethnographic inquiry into professionals' experiences of CYPM implementation in ﬁve diverse counties in a Midwestern state. During individual interviews, participants consistently described structural changes involving improved service provision to youth and families, and procedures and legal mandates for sharing information across departments. They also discussed psychosocial changes including improved professional support, strengthened relationships with other professionals and positive shifts in their ways of thinking and feeling about youth and their families. Participants also experienced implementation challenges including inadequate support and training of front line workers, distinguishing core features of the multifaceted model, and some issues in engaging families and key community stakeholders. Comparative case analyses across ﬁve counties suggest that systems change processes vary across and within local contexts. Implications for the implementation of systems change practice models in diverse contexts with professionals serving in various roles are discussed.},

Although little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this increased risk, the use of substitute care placement and placement instability are often identified as correlates. It is not clear from prior studies, however, whether delinquency precedes or follows placement instability. The current study adds significantly to the literature by identifying selected factors related to child maltreatment and delinquency and disentangling the timing of delinquency petitions relative to movements within the child welfare system. The results indicate that substantiated victims of maltreatment average 47\% higher delinquency rates relative to children not indicated for abuse or neglect. In addition, approximately 16\% of children placed into substitute care experience at least one delinquency petition compared to 7\% of all maltreatment victims who are not removed from their family. Placement instability further increases the risk of delinquency for male foster children, but not for female foster children. Other characteristics related to delinquency include race, age, and recurrence of maltreatment.},

	abstract = {Digital social data are now practically ubiquitous, with increasingly large and interconnected databases leading researchers, politicians, and the private sector to focus on how such ‘big data’ can allow potentially unprecedented insights into our world. This paper investigates Twitter activity in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in order to demonstrate the complex relationship between the material world and its digital representations. Through documenting the various spatial patterns of Sandy-related tweeting both within the New York metropolitan region and across the United States, we make a series of broader conceptual and methodological interventions into the nascent geographic literature on big data. Rather than focus on how these massive databases are causing necessary and irreversible shifts in the ways that knowledge is produced, we instead find it more productive to ask how small subsets of big data, especially georeferenced social media information scraped from the internet, can reveal the geographies of a range of social processes and practices. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we can uncover broad spatial patterns within this data, as well as understand how this data reflects the lived experiences of the people creating it. We also seek to fill a conceptual lacuna in studies of user-generated geographic information, which have often avoided any explicit theorizing of sociospatial relations, by employing Jessop et al’s TPSN framework. Through these interventions, we demonstrate that any analysis of user-generated geographic information must take into account the existence of more complex spatialities than the relatively simple spatial ontology implied by latitude and longitude coordinates.},

	abstract = {Neighborhoods have long held a central place in the analysis and planning of urban spaces. Despite this centrality, the exact definition of a neighborhood, as well as how and where to draw its boundaries, has remained unclear. Although these questions have generated significant academic debate, they have arguably little effect on people’s everyday lives or decision-making processes. Atlanta, Georgia, represents a different case, however, because of the city’s system of neighborhood planning units (NPUs), which has shaped the city’s planning and political processes since the mid-1970s. Despite significant changes within the city’s intraurban geography since the 1970s, however, the geography of the NPU system has remained largely unchanged. As such, this article attempts to harness the potentials of big data to rethink the nature and geographies of Atlanta’s neighborhoods. Drawing on archival documents, historic maps of the city’s neighborhoods, and new sources of big data, this article explores the evolution of Atlanta’s neighborhoods from the 1960s up to the present day. In particular, our analysis highlights the fundamentally fuzzy, fluid, and relational nature of neighborhoods, both in the ways in which neighborhoods are defined by political and administrative entities and through the everyday lives of residents. Ultimately, this work calls into question the idea of the neighborhood as a natural, preexisting, discrete, and static spatial unit and points to the utility of using new sources of data and analytical techniques for revealing this underlying relationality.},

Ten ACEs were measured, five types of child maltreatment and five types of household dysfunction. White youth experienced a significantly greater number of ACEs (4.08) compared to Black youth (2.90) and a greater prevalence of seven individual ACEs. According to logistic regression analyses, the number of ACEs significantly increased the likelihood of self-reported alcohol use, marijuana use, violence (in some models), and arrest at age 16 among Blacks but not Whites; race differences were statistically significant for alcohol use, marijuana use, and arrest. The findings support the need for juvenile justice officials to recognize the trauma histories of youth offenders when determining appropriate treatment and sanctions.},

Analyzing data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, this study assesses the associations between ACEs and delinquency and substance use separately for boys (n = 964) and girls (n = 947). Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models show that ACEs may be uniquely associated with delinquency for boys and substance use for girls.

Participants included 1236 adolescents from 13 schools in a large metropolitan area. ACEs were directly associated with both delinquency and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Direct associations between hope and both delinquency and posttraumatic stress were also found, such that greater hope was associated with fewer delinquent behaviors and fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms. Hope also functioned as a moderator; higher levels of hope weakened the strength of the association between ACEs and delinquency.

	abstract = {Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been identified as a key risk factor for a variety of negative health, psychiatric, and behavioral outcomes across the life course. Although recent research has begun to consider the role of ACEs in criminogenic behaviors among youth, few studies to date have assessed the association between early exposure to ACEs and delinquent behavior among nonincarcerated youth. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW; n = 3,402) and a life course theoretical framework, this study aims to address this gap in the literature by examining the relationships between individual, cumulative, and clustering of ACEs and delinquency in the lives of youth. The results of our empirical study indicate that individual, cumulative, and clustering of ACEs by the age of 5 years are associated with youth delinquent behavior. Based on our results, sociologists and criminologists should critically consider the role of ACEs in understanding youth delinquency.},

In addition, aggressive tendencies and a hostile interpretation of the actions of others and one?s environment increase antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, the pathways by which those effects occur are not well understood. Using a sample of more than 25,000 juvenile offenders, we use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the pathways by which adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affect juvenile delinquency. Results indicate ACEs have both a direct and indirect effect on recidivism, with nearly half of the total effect of ACEs on re-offending operating through negative emotionality.

	abstract = {Childhood maltreatment and inept parental disciplinary, attachment, and monitoring practices evidence a relationship with early and severe childhood and adolescent aggression and have figured prominently as causative factors in theoretical and empirical underpinnings of lifelong antisocial behavior. Abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction have been linked to both violent offending and higher scores on measures of dispositional tendencies associated with psychopathy. The current study incorporates these lines of research by examining a potential pathway by which cumulative adverse childhood experience exposure, rather than single exposures assessed independently, leads to chronic and serious juvenile offending. Specifically, we leverage a sample of 64,007 juvenile offenders who have aged out of the juvenile justice system to examine the extent to which the effects of traumatic exposure on age of onset (first arrest) as well as residential placement, total offenses, and serious, violent, and chronic offending up to age 18 are each mediated by psychopathic features. Results demonstrate that a substantial portion (37\%?93\%) of the effects of cumulative traumatic exposure on justice system outcomes is indirect, operating through these features, even after controlling for demographic and other criminogenic risk factors. Juvenile justice policy implications are discussed.},

Participants were aged 15–19 years, had not been tested for HIV in the previous 6 months, and had never been diagnosed with HIV. Anticipated stigma and risk perception were directly associated with depressive symptomatology and QOL. There was evidence of small indirect effects—through stigma—of risk perception on depressive symptomatology and QOL. Gender moderated relationships between sexual behavior and risk perception, depressive symptomatology, and QOL. Results suggest that developing effective gender-based interventions to address stigma, sexual behavior, and risk perception may be important for improving adolescent well-being in high HIV prevalence contexts.},

	abstract = {Background: A number of studies using cross-sectional data have demonstrated that the availability of alcohol, measured by the number and types of alcohol outlets, is directly related to numerous measures associated with drinking and driving. The current study contributes the ﬁrst observation of relationships over time between alcohol outlet densities on one hand and both automobile crashes and related injuries on the other hand.
Method: The study examined longitudinal data from 581 consistently deﬁned zip code areas represented in the California Index Locations Database, a geographic information system that coordinates population and ecological data with spatial attributes for areas across the state. Six years of data were collected on features of local populations (e.g., demographics, household size) and places (e.g., retail markets) thought to be related to two measures of automobile crashes (hospital discharges related to car crash injuries geocoded to the zip code of patient residence, and police reports associated with car crashes geocoded to the zip code of crash location). Both crash measures were positively associated with two outlet types: bars, and off-premise outlets. Additionally, restaurants appear to provide a protective effect relative to the residence-based measure. Crash rates were also related to changes in population and place characteristics using random effects models with controls for spatial autocorrelation (n × t = 3486 observations). Changes in population and place characteristics of adjacent (spatially lagged) areas were also considered.
Results: Over time, both local and lagged population and place characteristics were related to automobile crash-related measures.
Conclusion: Controlling for cross-sectional differences between zip code areas, changes in numbers of licensed alcohol retail establishments, especially bars and off-premise outlets, affect rates of car crashes and related injuries. © 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper demonstrates a network lattice approach for identifying road segments of particular concern, based on a case study of a major city (Leeds, UK), in which 5,862 crashes of different severities were recorded over an eight-year period (2011-2018). We consider a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that include spatially structured and unstructured random effects, to capture the dependencies between the severity levels. Results highlight roads that are more prone to collisions, relative to estimated traffic volumes, in the northwest and south of city-centre. We analyse the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), proposing a novel procedure to investigate the presence of MAUP on a network lattice. We conclude that our methods enable a reliable estimation of road safety levels to help identify "hotspots" on the road network and to inform effective local interventions.},

This paper highlights recent research focused on the academic performance of children and adolescents involved with child welfare and juvenile justice systems, with specific emphasis on highlighting prevention and intervention strategies that cut across systems. To meet the complex needs of these populations, school psychologists and other support staff should be cognizant of students’ academic needs and take a leadership role in collaborating within and across systems to meet them.},

In the three time periods, 873 individuals had an overdose diagnosis in the ED and 440 individuals in the county died of drug overdose. Results While total ED patient volume decreased substantially, the number of ED overdose patients increased between March 6 and June 25, 2020. Furthermore, during this same period, coroner data revealed an increase in overdose deaths. Conclusion and Scientific Significance This preliminary evidence provides a key insight into the impact of COVID-19 on both overdose presentations to the ED and county overdose deaths. These results emphasize the critical need for increasing vigilance to prevent overdose by continuously developing and optimizing both accessible and quality treatment as we navigate through this pandemic and its ongoing effects on persons with substance use disorder.

	abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges across the world in getting citizens to change their behaviors in response to a public health crisis. In the United States, it appears that partisan differences in willingness to comply with these measures have emerged: Democrats are typically more supportive than Republicans in their stated support of and willingness to comply with these measures. However, actual behaviors are notoriously hard to accurately capture with survey items. Objective To determine the extent to which county-level partisanship influences average willingness to stay at home, and how these effects are moderated by county level characteristics. Methods We use personal device (cell phone) data provided by SafeGraph, aggregated at the county-level, to determine how county-level partisanship is correlated with willigness to stay at home. We additionally test whether these effects are conditional upon the prevalence of COVID-19 in the county, and the percentage of the county under 30 years old. Results We find that county-level partisanship predicts aggregate level compliance with social distancing behavior—citizens of counties that are more Republican spend more time away from home than Democratic counties. We find that the number of COVID-19 cases in the county and the percentage of the county under the age of 30 moderate these effects. Conclusion Partisanship appears to be a powerful predictor, at the county-level, of willigness to follow stay at home orders in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented crisis with potential negative mental health impacts.
Methods: This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (N = 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders.
Results: For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. Limitations: The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected.
Conclusions: The present study suggests that although there were initial negative impacts on emotions and mental health symptoms in the first few weeks, many Americans demonstrated resilience over the following months. The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be as severe as predicted, although future work is necessary to understand longitudinal effects as the pandemic continues.},

	abstract = {Background: Strong evidence demonstrates that social support plays a key role in facilitating preventive health behaviors. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of perceived social support on compliance with stay-at-home orders in response to a COVID-19 outbreak during the Persian New Year (Nowruz) holydays, since Nowruz holidays of 2020 coincided with the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Iran.
Methods: This cross-sectional survey was carried out based on phone interviews of 1073 adults aged over 18 years from 4 to 12 April 2020 in Mashhad, Khorasan-Razavi Province, as the second largest city of Iran. A systematic random sampling was carried out using fixed phone number lists provided by Telecommunication Company of Khorasan-Razavi Province. Phone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers from the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) at various times of the day. The survey included sociodemographic questions, perceived social support scale (MSPSS) and questions about self-isolation during the Nowruz holiday. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression.
Results: 20.5\% of participants reported poor compliance with stay at home orders during the first 2 weeks of Nowruz. Clear social gradients were not found in stay-at-home compliance. When controlling socio-demographic factors, perceived social support, interestingly, both fostered and hindered people’s compliance with stay at home orders, depending on the source of support from family members (OR = .874, 95\% CI = .803, .950, p {\textless} .005), friends (OR = 1.147, 95\% CI = 1.076, 1.222, p {\textless} .001) and a significant other person (OR = .926, 95\% CI = .849, 1.010, p = .084).
Conclusions: Public health messaging may need to emphasize the role that friends and families can play in helping to protect those in their friendship/family groups by promoting compliance with social distancing. Further in-depth studies are recommended to evaluate how this kind of messaging can most effectively encourage people to engage in social distancing practices.},

	abstract = {In the absence of a vaccine and medical treatments, social distancing remains the only option available to governments in order to slow the spread of global pandemics such as COVID-19 and save millions of lives. Despite the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of social distancing measures, they are not being practiced uniformly across the U.S. Accordingly, the role of compact development on the level of adherence to social distancing measures has not been empirically studied. This longitudinal study employs a natural experimental research design to investigative the impacts of compact development on reduction in travel to three types of destinations representing a range of essential and non-essential trips in 771 metropolitan counties in the U.S during the shelter-in-place order amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We employed Multilevel Linear Modeling (MLM) for the three longitudinal analyses in this study to model determinants of reduction in daily trips to grocery stores, parks, and transit stations; using travel data from Google and accounting for the hierarchical (two-level) structure of the data. We found that the challenges of practicing social distancing in compact areas are not related to minimizing essential trips. Quite the opposite, residents of compact areas have significantly higher reduction in trips to essential destinations such as grocery stores/pharmacies, and transit stations. However, residents of compact counties have significantly lower reduction in their trips to parks possibly due to the smaller homes, lack of private yards, and the higher level of anxiety amid the pandemic. This study offers a number of practical implications and directions for future research.},

We also provide evidence that the estimated effect on post-order compliance is especially large for confidence in the press and governmental institutions, and relatively smaller for confidence in medicine and in science.},

In this paper, we focus on the impact of different work ethics on the spread of COVID-19. There are indeed reasons to believe that populations with different attitudes toward work will react differently to stay-at-home orders and other policies that forbid people from working. By means of a quantitative analysis, using hybrid model estimators, we test the impact of different work ethics on COVID-19 diffusion in a sample of 30 European countries. Results show that the more a population holds certain beliefs about work—namely, that it is humiliating to receive money without working, that people who do not work become lazy, and that work always comes first—the higher contagion rates of COVID-19 are, ceteris paribus. On the other hand, the more a population perceives work as a social duty, the lower contagion rates are. All this suggests that different work ethics matter in the containment of COVID-19.},

The sheer scale of behavior changes across a mass population scale is unprecedented and will un­ doubtedly cause disproportionate hardships for certain vulnerable groups of population and marginalized communities during different periods of the pandemic. However, at the community level, few studies have considered the spatial and temporal variations in such public health behavior changes during this pandemic. We applied a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of community stay-at-home behaviors against social vulnerability indicators at the census tract level in New York City from March to August 2020. Our findings are generally supporting the conventional wisdom of social vulnerability yet they also offer new insights. Despite the spatial variations in the effects of social vulnerability on stay-at-home behaviors, people from different vulnerable groups are also exhibiting varying reactions to the pandemic over the duration of this study, thereby highlighting the importance of understanding the spatio­ temporal pattern of public health behaviors to develop an effective policy response to avoid the risk of deepening inequalities and to promote a just and sustainable urban future.},

The mean decrease in visitation rates across destination categories was about 30 percent in states without stay-at-home orders and 40 percent in states with stay-at-home orders. Similarly, there were fewer routing requests received by Apple in large cities for public transportation, walking, and driving, with a 10 percentage point greater mean reduction in metropolitan areas under statewide stay-at-home orders. The pandemic led to large decreases in mobility even in states without legal restrictions on travel, but statewide orders were effective public health policy tools for reducing human movement below the level achieved through voluntary behavior change.},

Results indicate that five of the six jurisdictions experienced an immediate, significant spike in domestic violence calls for service (Cincinnati being the lone exception). As stay-at-home orders were lifted throughout the remainder of 2020, domestic violence calls for service declined in every jurisdiction but Salt Lake City. These results illustrate (1) the importance of studying the localized effects of COVID-19 on criminal justice issues, (2) the need for more agencies to publish open data in a timely fashion, and (3) the caution researchers and the public must use when working with calls for service data, which are not uniform across agencies and require careful cleaning prior to analysis.},

Two logistic regression models were developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N = 4618) were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-in-place period later that month. Both models were significant with multiple significant predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 20\% less likely to have occurred, and cases at residential locations were 22\% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-in-place period, cases at residential locations were 64\% more likely to have occurred, and cases with child victims were 67\% less likely to have occurred. This study offers a rapid analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power. Research, policy, and practice in this area must pivot to focus on protecting children whose access to mandated reporters has decreased and moving victims out of dangerous living situations into safe spaces.},

Crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential oﬀenders and victims. Understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the evolving crisis. Understanding how social distancing policies impact crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures. Examination of the most recently available data from both Los Angeles, CA, and Indianapolis, IN, shows that social distancing has had a statistically signiﬁcant impact on a few speciﬁc crime types. However, the overall eﬀect is notably less than might be expected given the scale of the disruption to social and economic life.},

	abstract = {Stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) were implemented in most U.S. states to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This paper quantifies the impact of these containment policies on a measure of the supply of child care. The supply of such services may be particularly vulnerable to a SAHO-type policy shock, given that many providers are liquidity-constrained. Using plausibly exogenous variation from the staggered adoption of SAHOs across states, we find that online job postings for early care and education teachers declined by 16\% after enactment. This effect is driven exclusively by private-sector services. Indeed, hiring by public programs like Head Start and prekindergarten has not been influenced by SAHOs. We also find that ECE job postings increased dramatically after SAHOs were lifted, although the number of such postings remains 4\% lower than that during the pre-pandemic period. There is little evidence that child care search behavior among households was altered by SAHOs. Because forced supply-side changes appear to be at play, our results suggest that households may not be well-equipped to insure against the rapid transition to the production of child care. We discuss the implications of these results for child development and parental employment decisions.},

The data were then analyzed using multiple regressions.Findings The findings show that attitude towards the behavior, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control positively and significantly affect intention to follow “Stay at Home” during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of COVID-19 do not significantly influence the intention to follow “Stay at Home” during the COVID-19 pandemic.Research limitations/implications This research was limited to the Greater Area of Jakarta, Indonesia. Furthermore, sampling was done through convenience sampling. Therefore, future research should be conducted in a different context to test the generalization of this research's findings.Practical implications To encourage citizens' adherence to the stay-at-home policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, they must be directed to have positive attitudes toward the policy. Financial and non-financial supports are critical to ensure citizens' ability to sufficiently observe the policy sufficiently. Another important aspect is the influence of leaders and public figures to consistently call for obedience consistently.Originality/value This is the first research that studies citizens' behavior related to the “Stay at Home” policy requisitioned by the government to hinder the spread of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of states, counties and cities in the United States issued mandatory stay-at-home orders as part of their efforts to slow down the spread of the virus. We argue that the consequences of this one-size-fits-all order will be differentially distributed among economic groups. In this paper, we examine social distance behavior changes for lower income populations. We conduct a comparative analysis of responses between lower-income and upper-income groups and assess their relative exposure to COVID-19 risks. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis of 3140 counties, we find social distance policy effect on the lower-income group is smaller than that of the upper-income group, by as much as 46\% to 54\%. Our explorations of the mechanisms behind the disparate effects suggest that for the work-related trips the stay-at-home orders do not significantly reduce low income work trips and this result is statistically significant. That is, the share of essential business defined by stay-at-home orders is significantly negatively correlated with income at county level. In the non-work-related trips, we find that both the lower-income and upper-income groups reduced visits to retail, recreation, grocery, and pharmacy visits after the stay-at-home order, with the upper-income group reducing trips more compared to lower-income group.},

For this study, participants took baseline survey online, then provided data three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) for 14 consecutive days using Ecological Momentary Assessment procedures. Data were collected from 323 participants, covering 9,357 observations from April 13 to May 27, 2020 in Central Ohio during stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19. Use of aggressive discipline, including corporal punishment and psychological aggression, was measured using the Dimensions of Discipline Inventory. For each higher level of stress, parents had 1.3 greater odds of using aggressive discipline. Having used aggressive discipline at baseline was related to three times greater odds of using it during the study period. Higher situational stress was associated with use of aggressive parenting. When combined with less contact with mandatory reporters, this places children at risk for abuse and neglect that may go without detection and intervention for longer time-periods. First responders and medical professionals become more important in identifying and reporting suspected child maltreatment, as this may be a child’s only contact with a mandated professional for six months to a year. Well child visits, routine vaccinations, and problem-focused care are important opportunities to assess parents’ stress and discipline practices that may be suggestive of abuse or neglect.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the confinement of most populations worldwide, through stay-at-home orders. Children have continued their education process at home, supervised by parents, who, in most cases, have adopted the role of prime drivers of their learning processes. In this study, the psychological impact of confinement was explored, as well as the relationship of the forced homeschooling situation with psychological well-being. During their confinement, 400 individuals residing in Spain—165 without children at home (Group 1), 104 parents who dedicated little time to homeschooling (Group 2), and 131 who dedicated more time to homeschooling (Group 3)—responded to an online questionnaire. The results show that confinement threatened the mental health of all the participants but especially Group 3 individuals, who had the highest loneliness, anxiety, and stress levels. Moreover, loneliness, perception of discomfort due to homeschooling, and anxiety exacerbated the stress experienced during confinement. Discomfort due to the homeschooling situation was especially relevant in explaining anxiety and stress for Group 3 individuals. These results suggest that forced homeschooling could be associated with the negative consequences that confinement has on individuals’ mental health. Moreover, the results suggest that parents who dedicate more time to homeschooling feel more unprotected and more stressed due to the homeschooling in comparison to Group 2 individuals. Health professionals must pay special attention to parents who dedicate more time to homeschooling, and governments and schools must emphasize social support provision to families during homeschooling situations.},

The confluence of these factors likely affects child health and well-being. We combine early release child maltreatment reports in Indiana with unique and newly available mobile phone movement data to better understand the relationship between staying at home intensively during the COVID-19 pandemic and child maltreatment. Our findings indicate that the prolonged stays at home promoted by the public health response to COVID-19 resulted in reductions in child maltreatment reports overall and in substantiated reports of maltreatment. However, relative to areas that stayed home less, children in areas that stayed home more were more likely to be both reported for and a confirmed victim of maltreatment, particularly neglect. These areas have historically been socioeconomically advantaged and experienced lower rates of maltreatment. We only observe increases in confirmed child maltreatment in metropolitan counties, suggesting that the effects of staying home on child maltreatment may reflect both the differential risk of leaving home and access to services in metropolitan–rather than non-metropolitan–counties. Policymakers should consider the impacts of stay-at-home orders on child well-being when determining the appropriate public health and re-opening responses.},

Using current, county-level data from Florida, we estimate a counterfactual distribution of child maltreatment allegations for March and April 2020, the ﬁrst two months in which Florida schools closed. While one would expect the ﬁnancial, mental, and physical stress due to COVID-19 to result in additional child maltreatment cases, we ﬁnd that the actual number of reported allegations was approximately 15,000 lower (27\%) than expected for these two months. We leverage a detailed dataset of school district stafﬁng and spending to show that the observed decline in allegations was largely driven by school closures. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our ﬁndings for the debate surrounding school reopenings and suggest a number of responses that may mitigate this hidden cost of school closures.},

	abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) has created an urgent need to identify child abuse and neglect (CAN) and efficiently allocate re­ sources to improve the coordination of responses during a public health crisis.
Objective: To provide unique insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of CAN in relation to COVID-19 outcomes and identify areas where CAN has increased or decreased during the pandemic. Participants: Children under 18 years old reported to the Los Angeles Police Department for CAN. Setting: CAN incidents in the city of Los Angeles.
Methods: Negative binomial regression was used to explore associations between the imple­ mentation of social distancing protocols and reported CAN during COVID-19. Spatiotemporal analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Associations between neighborhood structural factors (e.g., school absenteeism, poverty, unemployment, housing insecurity and birth assets) and hot and cold spot patterns were explored.
Results: There was a statistically significant decline in reports of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic but no significant trends following the implementation of social distancing measures (e.g. safer at home orders, school closures). Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions: Our findings reinforce the utility of developing intervention strategies that minimize harm to children by targeting resources to specific challenges facing families enduring the COVID19 experience.},

Objective: To examine caregiver-reported changes in the psychological well-being of their children 3 to 4 months after the start of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, and to examine the association of caregiver-reported COVID-19 exposure and family stressors with caregiver perceptions of child psychological well-being. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used an anonymous survey distributed via email from June 24 to July 15, 2020, to 350000 families of students attending public schools in Chicago, Illinois. The a priori hypotheses were that caregivers would report worsening in child psychological well-being during the closure period compared with preclosure and that exposure to COVID-19-related stressors would be associated with a higher probability of worsening child psychological well-being. Data were analyzed from September 10, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were 7 mental health concerns and 5 positive adjustment characteristics reported by caregivers using a retrospective pre-post  design. COVID-19 exposure and family stressors were also reported by caregivers.  Results: Among 350000 families invited to participate, 32217 caregivers (10827 [39.3\%] White, 8320 [30.2\%] Latinx, 6168 [22.4\%] Black; 2223 [8.1\%] with multiple or other races/ethnicities) completed the survey on behalf of 49397 children in prekindergarten through 12th grade. Child-specific outcomes were reported for 40723 to 40852 children depending on the specific question. The frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth mental health concerns ranged from 0.1 percentage  point (suicidal ideation or self-harm, reported by 191 caregivers [0.5\%] preclosure vs 246 caregivers [0.6\%] during closure; P {\textless} .001) to 28.3 percentage  points (loneliness, reported by 1452 caregivers [3.6\%] preclosure vs 13019 caregivers [31.9\%] during closure; P {\textless} .001) higher after the end of in-person instruction compared with preclosure. Frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth positive adjustment characteristics ranged from -13.4 percentage points (plans for the future, reported by 18114 caregivers [44.3\%] preclosure vs 12601 caregivers [30.9\%] during closure; P {\textless} .001) to -30.9 percentage points (positive peer relationships, reported by 24666 caregivers [60.4\%] preclosure vs 19130 caregivers [46.8\%] during closure; P {\textless} .001) lower after the end of in-person instruction. Significant differences in COVID-19 exposure were observed across racial/ethnic (F3,27534 = 614.8; P {\textless} .001) and household income strata (F5,27506  = 842.0; P {\textless} .001). After accounting for covariates, all mental health concerns increased in probability (eg, angry: odds ratio, 1.55 [95\% CI, 1.48-1.62]; P {\textless} .001) and all the positive adjustment characteristics decreased in probability (eg, hopeful or positive: odds ratio, 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.84-0.92]; P {\textless} .001) as COVID-19 exposure and family stressors increased. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and resulting exposure to stress were associated with worse youth psychological well-being, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive public health approach that prioritizes children's well-being and draws broad public attention to the mental health needs of youth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a large, initially uncontrollable, public health crisis both in the United States and across the world, with experts looking to vaccines as the ultimate mechanism of defense. The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers  to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. We investigated the spatiotemporal trends of public sentiment and emotion towards COVID-19 vaccines and analyzed how such trends relate to popular topics found on Twitter. METHODS:  We collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the United States from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified  3 phases along the pandemic timeline with sharp changes in public sentiment and emotion. Using sentiment analysis, emotion analysis (with cloud mapping of keywords), and topic modeling, we further identified 11 key events and major topics as the potential drivers to such changes. RESULTS: An increasing trend in  positive sentiment in conjunction with a decrease in negative sentiment were generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards vaccines. The overall tendency of the 8 types  of emotion implies that the public trusts and anticipates the vaccine. This is accompanied by a mixture of fear, sadness, and anger. Critical social or international events or announcements by political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on public opinion towards vaccines. These factors help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS:  The analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics, and promote the confidence that individuals within a certain region or community have towards vaccines.},

Our results demonstrate that stay-at-home orders, workplace closures, and public information campaigns were effective in decreasing the confirmed case growth rate.

Public information  campaigns did not see these same mobility trends, but the growth rate still decreased significantly in all analysis periods (p {\textless} 0.01). Stay-at-home orders and international/national travel controls had limited mitigation effects on the  death case growth rate (p {\textless} 0.1).

	abstract = {Introduction: Human mobility has been a central issue in the discussion from the beginning of COVID-19. While the body of literature on the relationship of COVID  transmission and mobility is large, studies mostly captured a relatively short timeframe. Moreover, spatial non-stationarity has garnered less attention in these explorative models. Therefore, the major concern of this study is to see the relationship of mobility and COVID on a broader temporal scale and after mitigating this methodological gap. Objective: In response to this concern, this  study first explores the spatiotemporal pattern of mobility indicators. Secondly, it attempts to understand how mobility is related to COVID infection rate and how this relationship has been changed over time and space after controlling several  sociodemographic characteristics, spatial heterogeneity, and policy-related changes during different phases of Coronavirus. Data and method: This study uses  GPS-based mobility data for a wider time frame of six months (March 20-August'20) divided into four tiers and carries analysis for all the US counties (N = 3142).  Space-time cube is used to generate the spatiotemporal pattern. For the second objective, Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Spatial Error Model (SEM), and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were used. Result: The spatial-temporal  pattern suggests that the trip rate, out-of-county trip rate, and miles/person traveled were mostly plummeted till the first wave reached its peak, and subsequently, all of these mobility matrices started to rise. From spatial models, infection rates were found negatively correlated with miles traveled and  out-of-county trips. Highly COVID infected areas mostly had more people working from home, low percentages of aged people and educated people, and high percentages of poor people. Conclusion: This study, with necessary policy implications, provides a comprehensive understanding of the shifting pattern of mobility and COVID. Spatial models outperform OLS with better fits and non-clustered residuals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. To better understand the epidemiology and relative effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated temporal changes in epidemiology related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS:  We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019-2020 season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020-May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks  and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40\% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and  overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR = 1.8; 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.9), obese (aOR = 2.5; 95\% CI 1.5 to 4.2), or reside in  a census tract with {\textgreater}/=40\% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR = 2.5; 95\% CI 1.3 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and disproportionate increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations among Hispanics after the shelter-in-place mandate indicates that public health strategies were inadequate in protecting this population-in particular, for those residing in neighborhoods with lower levels of educational attainment.},

	abstract = {Neighborhood disadvantage has consistently been linked to increased rates of morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms through which neighborhood environments may get "under the skin" remain largely unknown. Differential exposure to chronic environmental stressors has been identified as a potential pathway linking neighborhood disadvantage and poor health, particularly through the dysregulation of stress-related biological pathways such as cortisol secretion, but the majority of existing observational studies on stress and neuroendocrine functioning have focused exclusively on individual-level stressors and psychosocial characteristics. This paper aims to fill that gap by examining the association between features of the neighborhood environment and the diurnal  cortisol patterns of 308 individuals from Chicago, Illinois, USA. We found that respondents in neighborhoods with high levels of perceived and observed stressors or low levels of social support experienced a flatter rate of cortisol decline throughout the day. In addition, overall mean cortisol levels were found to be lower in higher stress, lower support neighborhoods. This study adds to the growing evidence of hypocortisolism among chronically stressed adult populations  and suggests hypocortisolism rather than hypercortisolism as a potential mechanism linking social disadvantage to poor health.},

Mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 inhabitants and the temporal trends were analysed using a segmented log-linear model. For spatial analysis, the Kernel estimator was used and the crude mortality rates were smoothed by the empirical Bayesian method. The space-time prospective scan statistics applied the Poisson's probability distribution model. There were 391 COVID-19 registered deaths, with the majority  among 60 years old (62\%) and males (53\%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (40\%), diabetes (31\%) and cardiovascular disease (15\%). An increasing mortality trend across the state was observed, with a higher increase  in the countryside. An active spatiotemporal cluster of mortality comprising the  metropolitan area and neighbouring cities was identified. The trend of COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe was increasing and the spatial distribution of deaths was heterogeneous with progression towards the countryside.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies suggested that almost one-third of U.S. adults did not plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine once it is available to them. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in vaccine intentions and attitudes by sociodemographic characteristics and geographic areas, factors associated with vaccination intent, and reasons for non-vaccination among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data from six waves of the Household Pulse Survey (6 January - 29 March 2021) were analyzed. Differences between January and March were assessed using t-tests. Factors associated with vaccination intent were examined in multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: From early January to late March, vaccination receipt of {\textgreater}/=1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or intention to definitely get vaccinated increased from 54.7 to 72.3\%; however, disparities in vaccination intent continued to exist by age group, race/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics. Vaccine receipt and the intent were the lowest for region 4 (southeastern U.S.) throughout this period. Adults who had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis or were unsure if they have  had COVID-19 were less likely to intend to get vaccinated [prevalence ratio = 0.92 (95\%CI: 0.90-0.93) and 0.80 (95\%CI: 0.74-0.85), respectively]. The belief that a vaccine is not needed increased by more than five percentage points from early January to late March. CONCLUSION: Intent to definitely get a COVID-19 vaccine increased by almost 18 percentage points from early January to late March; however, younger adults, adults who are non-Hispanic Black or other races, adults of lower socioeconomic status, and adults living in the southeastern U.S.  region (Region 4) continue to have higher coverage gaps and levels of vaccine hesitancy. Emphasizing the importance of vaccination among all populations, and removing barriers to vaccines, may lead to a reduction of COVID-19 incidence and  bring an end to the pandemic.KEY MESSAGESReceipt of {\textgreater}/=1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and intent to probably or definitely get vaccinated increased from early  January to late March; however, disparities in vaccine intent continued to exist  by age group, race/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics.Vaccine receipt and the intent were the lowest for region 4 (southeastern U.S.) compared  to other regions during this period.Adults who had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis  or were unsure if they have had COVID-19 were less likely to intend to get vaccinated; overall, the belief that a vaccine is not needed to be increased by more than 5\% points from early January to late March.[Formula: see text].},

Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of individual and municipal-level social inequalities on the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, from the Mexico City Epidemiological Surveillance System from February 24th, 2020, to March 31 st, 2021. COVID-19 outcomes included rates of hospitalization, severe COVID-19, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We evaluated socioeconomic occupation as an individual risk, and social lag, which captures municipal-level social vulnerability, and urban population density as proxies of structural risk factors. Impact of reductions in vehicular mobility on COVID-19 rates and the influence of risk factors were also assessed. Finally,  we assessed discrepancies in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality using death certificates from the General Civil Registry. RESULTS: We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically unfavored sectors and experienced  increased risk of COVID-19 outcomes. Cases living in marginalized municipalities  with high population density experienced greater for COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts modified by social lag and urban population density. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths along with an excess mortality closely related  to marginalized and densely populated communities in an ambulatory setting. This  could be attributable to a negative impact of modified hospital admission criteria during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic occupation and municipality-wide factors played a significant role in shaping the course of the  COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City.},

Data was collected from Marion County, Indiana (Indianapolis), including EMS calls for service (CFS) for suspected overdose, CFS in which naloxone was administered, and fatal overdose data from the County Coroner's Office. With two sample t tests and ARIMA time series forecasting, we showed changes in the daily rates of calls (all EMS CFS, overdose CFS, and CFS in which naloxone was administered) before and after the stay-at-home order in Indianapolis. We further showed differences in the weekly rate of overdose deaths. Overdose CFS and EMS naloxone administration showed an increase with the social isolation of the Indiana stay-at-home order, but a continued increase after the stay-at-home order was terminated. Despite a mild 4\% increase in all EMS CFS, overdose CFS increased 43\% and CFS with naloxone administration increased 61\% after the stay-at-home order. Deaths from drug overdoses increased by 47\%. There was no change in distribution of age, race/ethnicity, or zip code of those who overdosed after the stay-at-home order was issued. We hope this data informs policy-makers preparing for future COVID-19 responses and other disaster responses.},

We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset, a linked dataset combining the 2011 Census with primary care and hospital  records and death registrations, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and the first part of the second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated  age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups  compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions. The study  population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95\% CI: 303.7-376.2] and 166.8 [141.7-191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4-390.1] and 127.1 [91.1-171.3] in men and women) background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second  wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both  the first and the second waves. Between the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher  rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the disparate impact of COVID-19 on disadvantaged neighborhoods and racial/ethnic minorities in Chicago, Illinois. Using data from the Cook County Medical Examiner, we conducted a neighborhood-level analysis of COVID-19 decedents in Chicago and quantified age-standardized years of potential life lost (YPLL) due to COVID-19 among demographic subgroups and neighborhoods with geospatial clustering of high and low rates of COVID-19 mortality. We show that age-standardized YPLL was markedly  higher among the non-Hispanic (NH) Black (559 years per 100,000 population) and the Hispanic (811) compared with NH white decedents (312). We demonstrate that geomapping using residential address data at the individual-level identifies hot-spots of COVID-19 mortality in neighborhoods on the Northeast, West, and South areas of Chicago that reflect a legacy of residential segregation and persistence of inequality in education, income, and access to healthcare. Our results may contribute to ongoing public health and community-engaged efforts to  prevent the spread of infection and mitigate the disproportionate loss of life among these communities due to COVID-19 as well as highlight the urgent need to broadly target neighborhood disadvantage as a cause of pervasive racial inequalities in life and health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To better understand approaches to reducing mortality from the opioid epidemic, we analyzed in-hospital versus community opioid-related overdose deaths in Illinois. METHODS: We used data from the Statewide Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (July 2017 through December 2018) to identify deaths that occurred in hospitals and communities (ie, homes or public spaces). We used census tract-level data for 34 Illinois counties to create bivariate mapping by overdose death rates. We used logistic regression to analyze the association of demographic and overdose characteristics with the likelihood of death in a hospital versus a community. RESULTS: During the study period, 2833 opioid-related overdose deaths occurred in 24 Illinois counties, 655 (23.1\%) of which occurred in the hospital; of 2178 community deaths, 1888 (86.7\%) occurred in the same census tract as the decedent's recorded residence and 1285 (59.0\%) occurred in the decedent's home. Non-Hispanic Black people were 1.63 (95\% CI, 1.27-2.10) times more likely than non-Hispanic White people to die in a hospital. Decedents from suburban Cook County and other Chicago suburban counties were significantly more likely to die in the hospital than decedents from Chicago or other Illinois counties. Documentation of a previous overdose, history of opioid  use, and having bystanders present were significantly associated with hospital deaths. Evidence of a rapid overdose, fentanyl present, or prescription opioids were significantly associated with deaths in a community. CONCLUSIONS: The high number of opioid-related overdose deaths in the community illustrates the need to decriminalize illicit drug use and facilitate treatment seeking. Establishing supervised safe consumption sites may have the biggest effect in reducing the number of opioid-related overdose deaths.},

Thus we aim to analyse the spatiotemporal distribution and describe sociodemographic and clinical and operational characteristics of COVID-19-related deaths in a Brazilian state. METHODS: A descriptive and ecological study was carried out in the state of Maranhao. The study population consisted of deaths by COVID-19 in the period from 29 March to 31 July 2020. The detection of spatiotemporal clusters was performed  by spatiotemporal scan analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3001 deaths were analysed with an average age of 69 y, predominantly in males, of brown ethnicity, with arterial hypertension and diabetes, diagnosed mainly by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in public laboratories. The crude mortality rates the municipalities ranged from 0.00 to 102.24 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants and three spatiotemporal clusters of high relative risk were detected, with a mortality rate ranging from 20.25 to 91.49 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants per month.

We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting  the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care. SUMMARY: Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who  use substances.},

Data from 69 days of lockdown and 83 days of pre-lockdown periods were used to calculate the 30-day incidence rates. Results: During the 7-month study period, 5220 patients presented to our ED with trauma; 2296 in the prelockdown phase (83 days), 1205 during the lockdown phase (69 days), and 1719 during the postlockdown phase (92 days). There was a significant decrease (36.7\%) in the 30-day incidence rate of trauma victims presenting to the ED during the lockdown phase (525) compared with the prelockdown phase (830). The 30-day incidence of road traffic accidents (RTA), fall from height, fall on level ground and other trauma decreased by 53.2\%, 26\%, 23.2\% and 12.9\%, respectively, while assault cases increased by 8.3\%  during the lockdown period as compared with the prelockdown period.

METHODS: We  performed a retrospective analysis of three data sets: Chicago Fire Department EMS, Cook County Medical Examiner, and Illinois Poison Center. Each included data from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. EMS data included all EMS responses in Chicago, Illinois, for suspected opioid overdose in which naloxone was administered and EMS personnel documented other criteria indicative of opioid overdose. Medical Examiner data included all deaths in Cook County, Illinois, related to heroin, fentanyl or both. Illinois Poison Center data included all calls in Chicago, Illinois, related to fentanyl, heroin, and other prescription opioids. Descriptive statistics using Microsoft Excel(R) were used to analyze the data and create figures. RESULTS: We identified a spike in opioid-related EMS responses during an 11-day period from September 30-October 10, 2015. Medical Examiner data showed an increase in both fentanyl and mixed fentanyl/heroin related deaths during the months of September and October, 2015 (375\% and 550\% above the median, respectively.) Illinois Poison Center data showed no significant increase in heroin, fentanyl, or other opioid-related calls during September and October 2015. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that EMS data is an effective real-time surveillance mechanism for changes in the rate of opioid overdoses. Medical Examiner's data was found to be valuable for confirmation of EMS surveillance data and identification of specific intoxicants. Poison Center data did not correlate with EMS or Medical Examiner data.},

Early release, however, does not address how arrest and pretrial detention practices may be contributing to disease spread. Using data from Cook County Jail-one of the largest known nodes of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the  United States-in Chicago, Illinois, we analyzed the relationship between jailing  practices and community infections at the ZIP code level. We found that jail-community cycling was a significant predictor of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), accounting for 55 percent of the variance in case rates  across ZIP codes in Chicago and 37 percent of the variance in all of Illinois. Jail-community cycling far exceeds race, poverty, public transit use, and population density as a predictor of variance. The data suggest that cycling people through Cook County Jail alone is associated with 15.7 percent of all documented COVID-19 cases in Illinois and 15.9 percent of all documented cases in Chicago as of April 19, 2020. Our findings support arguments for reduced reliance on incarceration and for related justice reforms both as emergency measures during the present pandemic and as sustained structural changes vital for future  pandemic preparedness and public health.},

	issn = {2369-2960},
	doi = {10.2196/22578},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been implemented in the New York State since the COVID-19 outbreak on March 1, 2020 to control the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Socioeconomic heterogeneity across counties closely manifests differences in the  post-NPIs growth rate of incidence, which is a crucial indicator to guide future  infectious control policy making. Few studies, however, examined the geospatial and sociological variations in the epidemic growth across different time points of NPIs. OBJECTIVE: To guide a more effective reopening plan while controlling the transmission, the current study aims at 1) identifying hotspots of the growth rate of COVID-19 incidence among the 57 counties and New York City in NYS over time, and 2) examining the association of COVID-19 growth rates after eight critical NPIs time points and most relevant county-level sociological predictors. METHODS: County-level COVID-19 incidence rates were retrieved from the Social Explorer Website between March 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020. 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 incidence were calculated for 16 selected time points, including the dates of eight NPIs and their respective 14-day-lag-behind time points. A total of 36 county-level indicators were extracted from multiple public datasets. Geospatial mapping and heatmap were used to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of county-level COVID-19 outbreak over selected NPIs-related dates. Generalized mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, controlling for the 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 testing rates, was employed to identify significant county-level predictors related to the changes of county-level COVID-19 growth rates over time. RESULTS: COVID-19 infection increased and peaked by the end of March (eta=22.50\%). Growth rates of COVID-19 decreased by 50.48\% after implementing NPIs such as closures of schools, non-essential businesses, parks, and subways. There was a geospatial shift in the region with the highest growth rates from New York metropolitan area towards Western and Northern regions over time. Proportions of population aged 45 years and above (beta=3.25 [0.17-6.32]),  living alone at residential houses (beta=3.31 [0.39--6.22]), and proportion of crowd residential houses (beta=6.15 [2.15-10.14]) were positively associated with the growth rate of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, living alone at rental houses (beta=-2.47 [-4.83--0.12]) and rate of mental health providers (beta=-1.11 [-1.95--0.28]) were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rate across all 16 time points. CONCLUSIONS: There are geospatial differences in COVID-19 incidence  after implementing different NPIs. Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and healthcare resource disparities at the structural and historical levels across counties need to be considered in infection control policymaking to narrow the unequal health impact on vulnerable populations effectively.

The primary aim of the UIH/MSHC testing project was to increase testing capacity in the most affected, racial/ethnic minority communities. More than 7,500 tests were performed over a six-month period. Half of those who were tested were Black and Latinx residents.  The majority of those tested at the Walk-Up sites were Black, while "Other" race  group tended to get tested in Drive Thru testing sites. Latinx residents had the  highest positivity rate, followed by Other race group. Younger age groups were more likely to have higher positivity rates. Overall, UH/MSHC testing results reflected the overall Chicago COVID-19 testing results. Our findings substantiate the need to advocate for equitable resource allocation to counter the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection among minority communities. FQHCs were shown to be an effective approach to reduce structural barriers to COVID-19  testing and subsequently reduce disparities. Going forward, FQHCs can be key to ensuring COVID-19 vaccine outreach and dissemination.},

The international, public health crisis caused by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in unforeseen medical and psychiatric consequences. We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use.

Recent findings
Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care.

Summary
Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who use substances.},

Hence we will provide a natural framework involving a cross correlation for multivariate spatial eﬀect,i.e generalized multivariate conditional autoregressive model (GMCAR). We also focus on analysing the number of infected cases for two diseases in East Java Indonesia as the response variables. Therefore, in this paper we will propose a multivariate count data modelling with GMCAR to analyse the data.

        , As malaria transmission declines, it becomes increasingly important to monitor changes in malaria incidence rather than prevalence. Here, a spatio-temporal model was used to identify constituencies with high malaria incidence to guide malaria control. Malaria cases were assembled across all age groups along with several environmental covariates. A Bayesian conditional-autoregressive model was used to model the spatial and temporal variation of incidence after adjusting for test positivity rates and health facility utilisation. Of the 144,744 malaria cases recorded in Namibia in 2009, 134,851 were suspected and 9893 were parasitologically confirmed. The mean annual incidence based on the Bayesian model predictions was 13 cases per 1000 population with the highest incidence predicted for constituencies bordering Angola and Zambia. The smoothed maps of incidence highlight trends in disease incidence. For Namibia, the 2009 maps provide a baseline for monitoring the targets of pre-elimination.},

While stroke mortality rates are known to increase exponentially with age, an investigation of spatiotemporal trends by age group at the county level is daunting due to the preponderance of small population sizes and/or few stroke events by age group. In this paper, we implement a multivariate space–time conditional autoregressive model to investigate age-specific trends in county-level stroke mortality rates from 1973 to 2013. In addition to reinforcing existing claims in the literature, this work reveals that geographic disparities in the reduction of stroke mortality rates vary by age. More importantly, this work indicates that the geographic disparity between the "stroke belt" and the rest of the nation is not only persisting, but may in fact be worsening.},

	abstract = {Opioid misuse is a significant public health issue and a national epidemic with a high prevalence of associated morbidity and mortality. The epidemic is particularly severe in Ohio which has some of the highest overdose rates in the country. It is important to understand spatial and temporal trends of the opioid epidemic to learn more about areas that are most affected and to inform potential community interventions and resource allocation. We propose a multivariate spatio-temporal model to leverage existing surveillance measures, opioid-associated deaths and treatment admissions, to learn about the underlying epidemic for counties in Ohio. We do this using a temporally varying spatial factor that synthesizes information from both counts to estimate common underlying risk which we interpret as the burden of the epidemic. We demonstrate the use of this model with county-level data from 2007 to 2018 in Ohio. Through our model estimates, we identify counties with above and below average burden and examine how those regions have shifted over time given overall statewide trends. Specifically, we highlight the sustained above average burden of the opioid epidemic on southern Ohio throughout the 12 years examined.},

Age-/ sex-standardized asthma prevalence and health services use rates (2003–2013) were obtained from a provincial cohort of asthma patients. Employing an ecological-level study design, descriptive and Bayesian spatial regression analyses were used to examine patterns of asthma outcomes and their relationship to physical environment, socioeconomic environment and healthcare factors. Significant spatial variation in asthma outcomes was found between southern urban/suburban areas and northern/rural areas. Rurality was found to have a substantial effect on all asthma outcomes, except hospitalizations. For example, the most rural areas were associated with lower asthma prevalence and physician visits [RR = 0.708, 95\% credible interval (CI): 0.636–0.795 and RR = 0.630, 95\% CI: 0.504–0.758, respectively], and with higher ED visits (RR = 1.818, 95\% CI: 1.194–2.858), when compared to urban areas. Strong associations were also found between material deprivation and ED visits (RR = 1.559, 95\% CI: 1.358–1.737) and hospitalizations (RR = 1.259, 95\% CI: 1.143–1.374). Associations between asthma outcomes and environmental variables such as air pollution and temperature were also found. Findings can be expected to inform the development of improved public health strategies, which take into account local environmental, socioeconomic and healthcare characteristics.},

	abstract = {The rate of deaths from overdose has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent US overdose mortality rates have been markedly high. However, scant data are available on the causes of this increase or subpopulations at elevated risk.To evaluate the rates and characteristics of deaths from drug overdose before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic.This retrospective, population-based cohort study used data from 4 statewide databases linked at the person level via the Rhode Island Data Ecosystem on adults with deaths due to overdose in Rhode Island from January 1 to August 31, 2019, and January 1 to August 31, 2020.The rates of unintentional deaths from drug-related overdose during the 2019 and 2020 observation periods overall and by sociodemographic characteristics, drugs contributing to the cause of death, location of death, and socioeconomic factors were evaluated. In subgroup analyses restricted to Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 271), the proportions of deaths from overdose by behavioral health treatment and diagnosis claims in the year before death were also examined.A total of 470 adults who died of drug overdose were included in the analysis (353 men [75\%]; mean [SD] age, 43.5 [12.1] years). The rate of deaths from overdose in Rhode Island increased 28.1\%, from 29.2 per 100 000 person-years in 2019 to 37.4 per 100 000 person-years in 2020 (P = .009). Compared with 2019, rates of deaths due to overdose during 2020 were higher among men (43.2 vs 59.2 per 100 000 person-years; P = .003), non-Hispanic White individuals (31.0 vs 42.0 per 100 000 person-years; P = .005), single individuals (54.8 vs 70.4 per 100 000 person-years; P = .04), deaths involving synthetic opioids (20.8 vs 28.3 per 100 000 person-years; P = .005), and deaths occurring in a personal residence (13.2 vs 19.7 per 100 000 person-years; P = .003). A decrease in the proportion of deaths from overdose involving heroin (11 of 206 [5\%] vs \&lt;2\% [exact value suppressed]; P = .02) and an increase among persons experiencing job loss (16 of 206 [8\%] vs 41 of 264 [16\%]; P = .01) from 2019 to 2020 were observed. Among individuals who died of overdose and were Medicaid beneficiaries, the proportions of those aged 50 to 59 years with anxiety (11 of 121 [9\%] vs 29 of 150 [19\%]; P = .03), men with depression (27 of 121 [22\%] vs 57 of 150 [38\%]; P = .008), and men with anxiety (28 of 121 [23\%] vs 55 of 150 [37\%]; P = .02) increased during 2020 compared with 2019.In this cohort study, during the first 8 months of 2020, the rate of deaths from overdose increased in Rhode Island compared with the same period in 2019, and several emerging characteristics of deaths from drug overdose during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified. These findings may inform interventions that address macroenvironmental changes associated with the pandemic.},

Data was collected from Marion County, Indiana (Indianapolis), including EMS calls for service (CFS) for suspected overdose, CFS in which naloxone was administered, and fatal overdose data from the County Coroner’s Office. With two sample t tests and ARIMA time series forecasting, we showed changes in the daily rates of calls (all EMS CFS, overdose CFS, and CFS in which naloxone was administered) before and after the stay-at-home order in Indianapolis. We further showed differences in the weekly rate of overdose deaths. Overdose CFS and EMS naloxone administration showed an increase with the social isolation of the Indiana stay-at-home order, but a continued increase after the stay-at-home order was terminated. Despite a mild 4\% increase in all EMS CFS, overdose CFS increased 43\% and CFS with naloxone administration increased 61\% after the stay-at-home order. Deaths from drug overdoses increased by 47\%. There was no change in distribution of age, race/ethnicity, or zip code of those who overdosed after the stay-at-home order was issued. We hope this data informs policy-makers preparing for future COVID-19 responses and other disaster responses.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic, and social challenges that continue to escalate. Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What’s more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.},

To quantify lessons learned to better prepare for similar pandemic crisis in the future, we assess the overall impact of social distancing on the daily growth rate of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. during the initial phase of the pandemic and the impacts’ heterogeneity by urbanity and social vulnerability of the counties. The initial phase is chosen to purposely identify the essential and largest impact of the first-line of defense measure for similar pandemic: social distancing.

Methods.
Spatial Durbin models with county fixed effects were used to account for spatial dependencies and identify spatial spillover effects and spatial heterogeneity.

Results.
Besides the substantial curve flattening effects of social distancing, our results show significant spillover effects induced by neighboring counties’ social distancing levels even in the absence of significant within-county effects. Urban and areas with high social vulnerability are the ones benefit the most from social distancing and high level of compliance is needed. Moderate level is enough in reaching the peak marginal impact in rural and areas with low social vulnerability.},

In a two-week look-ahead test of out-of-sample forecasting accuracy, our model signiﬁcantly outperforms the widely used model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), achieving 42\% lower prediction error: 13.2 deaths per day average error across all U.S. states, versus 22.8 deaths per day average error for the IHME model. Our model also provides an accurate, if slightly conservative, assessment of forecasting accuracy: in the same look-ahead test, 98\% of data points fell within the model’s 95\% credible intervals.

Businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable. There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that, before the pandemic hit, 43 million workers worked in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Many of these workers lost their jobs since. Consistently with our model, employment losses have been largest in sectors that rely heavily on customer contact and where these contacts dropped the most: retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools. Our results can help quantify the economic costs of social distancing.},

	abstract = {The opioid crisis in the United States has been defined by waves of drug- and locality-specific Opioid use-Related Epidemics (OREs) of overdose and bloodborne infections, among a range of health harms. The ability to identify localities at risk of such OREs, and better yet, to predict which ones will experience them, holds the potential to mitigate further morbidity and mortality. This narrative review was conducted to identify and describe quantitative approaches aimed at the “risk assessment,” “detection” or “prediction” of OREs in the United States. We implemented a PubMed search composed of the: (1) objective (eg, prediction), (2) epidemiologic outcome (eg, outbreak), (3) underlying cause (ie, opioid use), (4) health outcome (eg, overdose, HIV), (5) location (ie, US). In total, 46 studies were included, and the following information extracted: discipline, objective, health outcome, drug/substance type, geographic region/unit of analysis, and data sources. Studies identified relied on clinical, epidemiological, behavioral and drug markets surveillance and applied a range of methods including statistical regression, geospatial analyses, dynamic modeling, phylogenetic analyses and machine learning. Studies for the prediction of overdose mortality at national/state/county and zip code level are rapidly emerging. Geospatial methods are increasingly used to identify hotspots of opioid use and overdose. In the context of infectious disease OREs, routine genetic sequencing of patient samples to identify growing transmission clusters via phylogenetic methods could increase early detection capacity. A coordinated implementation of multiple, complementary approaches would increase our ability to successfully anticipate outbreak risk and respond preemptively. We present a multi-disciplinary framework for the prediction of OREs in the US and reflect on challenges research teams will face in implementing such strategies along with good practices.},

We leveraged provisional records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided as rolling 12-month sums, which are helpful for smoothing, yet may mask pandemic-related spikes in overdose mortality. We cross-referenced these rolling aggregates with previous monthly data to estimate monthly drug-related overdose mortality for January through July 2020. We quantified historical errors stemming from reporting delays and estimated empirically derived 95\% prediction intervals (PIs). Results. We found that 9192 (95\% PI = 8988, 9397) people died from drug overdose in May 2020—making it the deadliest month on record—representing a 57.7\% (95\% PI = 54.2\%, 61.2\%) increase over May 2019. Most states saw large-magnitude increases, with the highest in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. We observed low concordance between rolling 12-month aggregates and monthly pandemic-related shocks. Conclusions. Unprecedented increases in overdose mortality occurred during the pandemic, highlighting the value of presenting monthly values alongside smoothed aggregates for detecting shocks. Public Health Implications. Drastic exacerbations of the US overdose crisis warrant renewed investments in overdose surveillance and prevention during the pandemic response and postpandemic recovery efforts.},

	abstract = {Background: Reports analyzing drug overdose (OD) mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic are limited. Outcomes across states are heterogenous, necessitating assessments of associations between COVID-19 and OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID19.
Methods: Analyzing 3,924 death records, we characterize opioid-, cocaine-, and amphetamine-involved OD mortality and substance co-presence trends from March 24-November 8 in 2020 as compared to 2018 and 2019.
Results: OD deaths involving amphetamines increased by 85\% from 2019 to 2020 (61 vs. 113; P{\textless}0.001) but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroin’s presence continued to decrease (341 in 2018, 247 in 2019, 157 in 2020; P{\textless}0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 85\% of all OD deaths across all periods. Among OD deaths, alcohol involvement consistently increased, present in 250 deaths in 2018, 299 in 2019 (P=0.02), and 350 in 2020 (P=0.04). In 2019, 78\% of OD decedents were White and 7\% were Black, versus 73\% and 10\% in 2020 (P=0.02).
Conclusion: Increased deaths involving stimulants, alcohol, and fentanyl reﬂect concerning trends in the era of COVID-19. Rising OD death rates among Black residents underscore that interventions focused on racial equity are necessary.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals with opioid use disorder may be at heightened risk of opioid overdose during the COVID-19 period of social isolation, economic distress, and disrupted treatment services delivery. This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020.
Methods: We evaluated the statistical signiﬁcance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020.
Results: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17\% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71\% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50\% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased signiﬁcantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period.
Conclusions: This Kentucky-speciﬁc study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from diﬀerent regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.},

Although area gradients were less pronounced for women in each age group, they rose sharply for women aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 years., Conclusions. Areal inequalities in mortality widened because of slower mortality declines in more deprived areas.

	abstract = {Spatial data relating to non-overlapping areal units are prevalent in fields such as economics, environmental science, epidemiology and social science, and a large suite of modeling tools have been developed for analysing these data. Many utilize conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors to capture the spatial autocorrelation inherent in these data, and software packages such as CARBayes and R-INLA have been developed to make these models easily accessible to others. Such spatial data are typically available for multiple time periods, and the development of methodology for capturing temporally changing spatial dynamics is the focus of much current research. A sizeable proportion of this literature has focused on extending CAR priors to the spatio-temporal domain, and this article presents the R package CARBayesST, which is the first dedicated software package for spatio-temporal areal unit modeling with conditional autoregressive priors. The software package allows to fit a range of models focused on different aspects of spacetime modeling, including estimation of overall space and time trends, and the identification of clusters of areal units that exhibit elevated values. This paper outlines the class of models that the software package implement, before applying them to simulated and two real examples from the fields of epidemiology and housing market analysis.},

	abstract = {We develop a Bayesian inferential framework for the spread of COVID-19 using mechanistic epidemiological models, such as SIR or SEIR, and allow the effective contact rate to vary in time. A novel aspect of our approach is the incorporation of a time-varying reporting rate accounting for the initial phase of the pandemic before testing was widely available. By varying both the reporting rate and the effective contact rate in time, our models can capture changes in the data induced by external influences, such as public health intervention measures, for example. We view COVID-19 incidence data as the observed measurements of a hidden Markov model, with latent space represented by the underlying epidemiological model, and employ a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) sampling scheme for Bayesian inference. Parameter inference is performed via PMCMC on incidence data collated by the New York Times from the states of New York and Tennessee from March 1, 2020 through August 30, 2020. Lastly, we perform Bayesian model selection on the different formulations of the epidemiological models, make predictions from our fitted models, and validate our predictions against the true incidence data for the week between August 31, 2020 and September 7, 2020.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Non-fatal overdose remains a signiﬁcant source of morbidity among people who inject drugs (IDU). Although depression and social support are important in shaping the health of IDU, little is known about the relationship between these factors and overdose. Therefore, we sought to determine whether depressive symptoms and social support predicted non-fatal overdose among IDU in a Canadian setting.
Methods: Data were derived from three prospective cohorts of people who use drugs: the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS), the ACCESS Cohort, and the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS). Multilevel modeling was used to determine if depression and social support were signiﬁcant predictors of non-fatal overdose across time. Analyses were stratiﬁed by sex.
Results: There were 1931 participants included in this analysis, including 653 (33.8\%) females and 69 (3.6\%) youth 20 years old or younger. Depressed men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.53, 95\% conﬁdence intervals [CI] = 1.25, 1.87) and women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.23, 95\% conﬁdence intervals [CI] = 1.65, 3.00) were more likely to experience a non-fatal overdose. Further, among women, those who reported having 3 or more persons they could rely upon for social support were less likely to experience a non-fatal overdose (AOR = 0.54, 95\% CI 0.31, 0.93).
Conclusion: Although depression was a signiﬁcant predictor of non-fatal drug overdose, social support was a signiﬁcant predictor among women only. Possible strategies to prevent non-fatal overdose may include identifying IDU experiencing severe depressive symptoms and providing targeted mental health treatments and mobilizing interpersonal social support among IDU, especially among women.},

Methods: Data were derived from a longitudinal study of 15–30 year old IDUs and NIDUs (N = 309) who had initiated heroin, cocaine, and/or crack use within 5 years prior to study enrollment. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used in bivariate analyses of demographic and drug use variables with each of the two dependent variables.

	abstract = {Introduction and Aims Drug overdose and suicide are the two leading causes of death among street youth. The literature discusses the two faces of drug overdose: accidental act and suicide attempt. Some authors have stated that accidental overdoses may be a hidden expression of suicidal ideation. This study longitudinally examined the relationship between recent suicidal ideations and non-fatal accidental drug overdoses among street youth. Design and Methods Between July 2001 and December 2005, 858 street youth (14–23 years old) were recruited for a prospective cohort study. Youth were eligible if, in the previous year, they had been without a place to sleep more than once or had used the services of street youth agencies on a regular basis (≥3). Participants completed baseline questionnaires and follow-up interviews were carried out every 6 months. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were conducted. Apart from suicidal ideation and accidental drug overdose, variables considered in the model were age, sex, problematic alcohol use, homelessness, injection drug use and polydrug use (≥3 drugs). Results Accidental drug overdose was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio 1.88; 95\% confidence interval 1.23–2.54). Homelessness, injection drug use and polydrug use were also significant in the final model. Discussion and Conclusions Results show that, during follow up, suicidal ideation independently increased risks of accidental overdose. They also underscore the need for interventions beyond educational prevention. Primary care practitioners should investigate suicidal ideations and behaviours of street youth in treatment for accidental overdose. [Richer I, Bertrand K, Vandermeerschen J, Roy É.

	abstract = {Nonmedical prescription opioid misuse remains a growing public problem in need of action and is concentrated in areas of US states with large rural populations such as Kentucky, West Virginia, Alaska, and Oklahoma. We developed hypotheses regarding the influence of 4 factors: (1) greater opioid prescription in rural areas, creating availability from which illegal markets can arise; (2) an out-migration of young adults; (3) greater rural social and kinship network connections, which may facilitate drug diversion and distribution; and (4) economic stressors that may create vulnerability to drug use more generally. A systematic consideration of the contexts that create differences in availability, access, and preferences is critical to understanding how drug use context varies across geography.},

	abstract = {This study identifies sociodemographic predictors of prescription opioid use among older adults (age 65+) during the peak decade of U.S. opioid prescription, and tests whether pain level and Medicaid coverage mediate the association between low wealth and opioid use. Predictors of prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and of opinions of both drug classes, are also examined.Regressions of opioid and NSAID use on sociodemographic characteristics, pain level, and insurance type were conducted using Health and Retirement Study 2004 core and 2005 Prescription Drug Study data (n = 3,721). Mediation analyses were conducted, and user opinions of drug importance, quality, and side effects were assessed.Low wealth was a strong, consistent predictor of opioid use. Both pain level and Medicaid coverage significantly, but only partially, mediated this association. Net of wealth, there were no significant associations between education and use of, or opinions of, either class of drugs.Among older American adults, the poorest are disproportionately likely to have been exposed to prescription opioid analgesics. Wealth, rather than education, drove social class differences in mid-2000s opioid use. Opioid-related policies should take into account socioeconomic contributors to opioid use, and the needs and treatment histories of chronic pain patients.},

	abstract = {Drug overdose is now the leading cause of unintentional death nationwide, driven by increased prescription opioid overdoses. To better understand urban opioid overdose deaths, this paper examines geographic, demographic, and clinical differences between heroin-related decedents and prescription opioid decedents in San Francisco from 2010 to 2012. During this time period, 331 individuals died from accidental overdose caused by opioids (310 involving prescription opioids and 31 involving heroin). Deaths most commonly involved methadone (45.9 \%), morphine (26.9 \%), and oxycodone (21.8 \%). Most deaths also involved other substances (74.9 \%), most commonly cocaine (35.3 \%), benzodiazepines (27.5 \%), antidepressants (22.7 \%), and alcohol (19.6 \%). Deaths were concentrated in a small, high-poverty, central area of San Francisco and disproportionately affected African-American individuals. Decedents in high-poverty areas were significantly more likely to die from methadone and cocaine, whereas individuals from more affluent areas were more likely die from oxycodone and benzodiazepines. Heroin decedents were more likely to be within a younger age demographic, die in public spaces, and have illicit substances rather than other prescription opioids. Overall, heroin overdose death, previously common in San Francisco, is now rare. Prescription opioid overdose has emerged as a significant concern, particularly among individuals in high-poverty areas. Deaths in poor and affluent regions involve different causative opioids and co-occurring substances.},

This study used consensual qualitative research methodology to analyze focus group data from individuals in short- and long-term recovery in rural Michigan and Minnesota. Coding was conducted within a recovery capital framework to improve understanding of the resources and barriers participants experienced in their recovery. Key findings included barriers related to transportation, as well as access to and availability of sober meetings and sober living activities. Participants perceived connections to culturally appropriate treatment as particularly important. A reconstruction of social networks from those promoting addiction to those supporting recovery was also prominently emphasized. Recovery capital appears to be a useful framework for assessing how rural communities are experiencing substance use crises, in addition to identifying areas of low capital and high need in supporting long-term recovery.},

Alabama highlighted the importance of an individual?s ?incorrigibility? and the prospect of ?irreparable corruption? when weighing possible life sentencing for juveniles convicted of homicide. In this review, we study research in multiple content areas spanning homicide recidivism, life-course-persistent or career criminality, and psychopathology and incorrigibility that bears relevance to the risk assessment of juvenile homicide offenders. A well-developed corpus of research and scholarship in these domains documents the severe, lifelong behavioral impairments of the most violent delinquents. In contrast to studies of non-offender student samples and behaviors that bear no ecological validity to juvenile homicide, the research covered herein emanates from epidemiological surveys, birth cohort studies, large-scale prospective longitudinal studies, and correctional studies including homicide offenders and appropriate control groups of other serious delinquents. A rich research foundation in the social, behavioral, and forensic science informs relevant, reliable, and valid forensic assessments of future criminal deviance and incorrigibility in juvenile homicide offenders.},
